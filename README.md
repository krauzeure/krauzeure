### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

 ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=krauzeure&left_color=Dimgray&right_color=darkgreen)

I'm a Front End Developer, I love building experiences for the web!

My main stacks are `React.js`, `Next.js` and `Typescript`, but I'm always up for learning new stuff. I've been working at tech start ups for the last 10 years and I enjoy working for mission-driven projects (education, women's rights, ...)

I'm a football (and Bayern Munich) fan :soccer: I love writing, reading, and drawing, and I'd love to write stories one day.

Feel free to have a look at [my portfolio](https://cyriellechasles.com/) as well!
